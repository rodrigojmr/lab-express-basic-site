        <p>
          Dr. Kanojia is a psychiatrist and reformed gamer. His training
          includes working at the worldâ€™s leading medical institutions: Harvard
          Medical School, McLean Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, he is a gamer who almost failed out of college. He
          graduated with a 2.5 GPA, got his own gaming habits under control, and
          went on to do his psychiatry residency through Harvard Medical School.
        </p>
        <p>
          During his training, Dr. Kanojia noticed a lack of academic knowledge
          of video game addiction. He interviewed hundreds of gamers and created
          extensive psychiatric profiles of gamers that now can be used to
          inform treatment plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Kanojia combines eastern meditative techniques, cutting edge
          neurochemistry research and successful addiction interventions to
          cerate a new approach to video gaming addiction. His focus on
          real-world success goes beyond addiction treatment to give gamers the
          tools they need to re-engage with the real world on their terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Dr. Kanojia and the Healthy Gamer team work in many different
          forms to empower people to take on video gaming addiction.
