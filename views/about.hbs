      Dr. Kanojia is a psychiatrist and reformed gamer. His training
      includes working at the worldâ€™s leading medical institutions: Harvard
      Medical School, McLean Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, he is a gamer who almost failed out of college. He
      graduated with a 2.5 GPA, got his own gaming habits under control, and
      went on to do his psychiatry residency through Harvard Medical School.

      During his training, Dr. Kanojia noticed a lack of academic knowledge
      of video game addiction. He interviewed hundreds of gamers and created
      extensive psychiatric profiles of gamers that now can be used to
      inform treatment plans.

      Dr. Kanojia combines eastern meditative techniques, cutting edge
      neurochemistry research and successful addiction interventions to
      cerate a new approach to video gaming addiction. His focus on
      real-world success goes beyond addiction treatment to give gamers the
      tools they need to re-engage with the real world on their terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Dr. Kanojia and the Healthy Gamer team work in many different
      forms to empower people to take on video gaming addiction.
